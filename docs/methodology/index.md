# Project Methodologies 🚀

Our team, BenRover, employs a structured approach to project management to ensure effective collaboration and timely delivery of our Mars Rover project. Here's an overview of our key methodologies:

## Team Structure 👥

We have organized our team into five specialized groups, each focusing on critical aspects of the rover development:

1. Mechanical Engineering Team (5 members) 🔧
2. Electrical Engineering Team (5 members) ⚡
3. IT Team (5 members) 💻
4. Space Science Team (3 members) 🌌
5. Operations/Project Management Team (5 members) 📊

Team members represent various universities within Benin and abroad, as well as the Sémè City Open Park.

## Regular Meetings 🗓️

- Weekly general body meetings every Thursday
- Allocated Sundays for concentrated work and cross-team collaboration

## Project Management Tools 🛠️

- Trello for task management
- Gantt chart for project timeline visualization
- Detailed task sheets with specific information

## Project Plan 📝

We maintain a comprehensive project plan detailing:

- Tasks
- Deadlines ⏰
- Dependencies

## Lessons Learned & Adaptations 📚

1. **Parts Procurement**: 
   - Challenge: Difficulty finding specific parts locally 🔍
   - Solution: Searching in neighboring countries, considering design updates

2. **Software Learning Curve**: 
   - Challenge: Limited ROS2 resources 📖
   - Solutions: 
     - Using Docker containers for consistent development environments 🐳
     - Investing in specialized ROS2 training
     - Referring to available documentation and existing projects
     - Encouraging iterative development

3. **Team Coordination**: 
   - Challenge: Organizing regular meetings with a diverse team 🌍
   - Solutions:
     - Established structured schedule accommodating different team members
     - Implemented focused approach to discussions
     - Created centralized repository for documenting insights and solutions

4. **Power Management**: 
   - Challenge: Insufficient power supply and overheating 🔋
   - Solution: Proper sizing of power supply based on component requirements

5. **Wiring and Connections**: 
   - Challenge: Signal interference 📡
   - Solution: Special routing for wires to avoid interference

6. **Motor Control**: 
   - Challenge: Selecting appropriate motor drivers 🔄
   - Solution: Extensive testing of different drivers

7. **Camera Setup**: 
   - Challenge: Initial difficulty in receiving images 📷
   - Solution: Persistent research and testing

By implementing these methodologies and learning from our experiences, we aim to overcome challenges and deliver a successful Mars Rover for the African Rover Challenge. 🌟
